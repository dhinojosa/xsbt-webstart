A Webstart plugin for xsbt

At the moment, this is only a rough draft, just enough to get my own
projects running. Let me know what you think.

To build this code, get and install SBT from 
    https://github.com/harrah/xsbt

Build and publish the plugin:
    git clone git@github.com:ritschwumm/xstb-webstart.git
    cd xstb-webstart
    sbt publish-local
    
Add the plugin to your project in project/plugins/build.sbt:
    addSbtPlugin("de.djini" % "xsbt-webstart" % "0.0.5")
    
Include the plugin in you project's build.sbt:

    seq(WebStartPlugin.allSettings:_*)
    
    webstartGenConf := GenConf(
        dname       = "CN=Snake Oil, OU=An Anonymous Hacker, O=Bad Guys Inc., L=Bielefeld, ST=33641, C=DE",
        validity    = 365
    )

    webstartKeyConf := KeyConf(
        keyStore    = file("my/keyStore"),
        storePass   = "password",
        alias       = "alias",
        keyPass     = "password"
    )
    
    webstartJnlpConf    := Seq(JnlpConf(
        mainClass		= "my.Main",
        fileName        = "my.jnlp",
        codeBase        = "http://my.test/webstart/",
        title           = "My Title",
        vendor          = "My Company",
        description     = "My Webstart Project",
        offlineAllowed  = true,
        allPermissions  = true,
        j2seVersion     = "1.6+",
        maxHeapSize     = 192
    ))

Once set up you can use the following tasks in sbt:

    webstart        creates a directory with a JNLP file and all necessary jar files
    webstart-keygen creates a keyStore, fails if it already exists
